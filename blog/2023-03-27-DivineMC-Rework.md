## DivineMC Rework
Recently we started to rework DivineMC. We will use Purpur upstream, because it has a lot of features, which Paper doesn't have. So many features and improvments will be added to this version.

## How to download beta version?
You can download beta versions from [here](https://github.com/DivineMC/DivineMC/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Arework+is%3Asuccess) (you need to be logged in to GitHub). You need to select the latest build and download the artifact.
