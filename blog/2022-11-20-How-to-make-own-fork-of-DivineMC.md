If you have been wondering if it is possible to make your own kernel based on DIvineMC, then we have already done everything for you!

You can use our template-repository called Waterbird. To change name of your fork, edit file `build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts` and `gradle.properties` with your names.

To make changes to Bukkit, Paper and etc. you need to know how [git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) works.

Also if you want to contribute to DivineMC - you can read docs [here](https://divinemc.bxteam.gq/docs/contributing).

##### P.S. Im too lazy to write blogs here :(
