Today, we are excited to announce the release of an experimental version of DivineMC for the latest Minecraft version 1.20. It took 2 days to update project to 1.20 version.

We are excited to hear your feedback on this new version of DivineMC for Minecraft 1.20, and we encourage you to share your thoughts and ideas with us in our discord server. Your feedback is important to us and will help us to improve the project even further.

## Update 13.06.2023

Mojang released 1.20.1 on 12.06.2023 and DivineMC was already updated. Download new latest version [here](https://github.com/DivineMC/DivineMC/releases/tag/latest-1.20.1)

This update is compatible with 1.20, and is mostly a mixture of client updates (bug fixes) and nothing new.
