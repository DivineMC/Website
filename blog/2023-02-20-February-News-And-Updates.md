# February: News and Updates

## Whats new?

- We updated the guide to Aikar's Flags. Now it's more detailed and easier to understand. But you can still use old flags, but we don't recommend to use it on production server!

## What next?

We will continue to develop the project on Pufferfish upstream. We will also continue to update the docs, add new features and fix bugs. Stay tuned!
